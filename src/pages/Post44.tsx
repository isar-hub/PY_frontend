            and from time to time for the sake of diversity can develop their
            sexual activities. The exchange of the condom when engaging with
            several people or orifices on a woman's body would be the right
            thing to do.

            Choosing the right lubricant is crucial when using sex toys. Every
            toy is different. For example, water-based lubricants can be used
            with all toy materials, but avoid silicone toys with silicone-based
            lubricants because they can be damaged by silicone toys. Also, make
            sure that the products are compatible for usage before using them.
